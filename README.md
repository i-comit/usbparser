# icomit-usbparser

Written in Java. You will require Java Runtime Environment 8 (duh) <br>
Parses USB devices and returns hardware information via wmic. <br>

Only works on Windows at the moment. <br>
Will also change the drive icon, working on a user setting to disable it or put their own image in. <br>
Maybe a GUI even. <br>

Personal Note: Scanner from Main.java breaks the Scanner from USBParseOne.java, dunno why. <br>
